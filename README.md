 ## **Tired of your passwords being stored in the cloud?** Here is a fully open-source, locally-stored HIGH encryption password manager.

SecureVault stores all your passwords in an encrypted file that can only be opened using your Personal Access Token

# Setup
Just run the .app (Mac OS X only for now) and enter the Token you would like to use as your unlocking PAT. It can be anything. This is NOT stored on your device

Now you can add credentials and keep them locally, automatically, with peace of mind knowing they are HEAVILY encrypted.

For extra security, make your PAT unique, with numbers, capital letters, and symbols, while still remembering it.
